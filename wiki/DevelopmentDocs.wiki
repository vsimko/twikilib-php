 * Install Eclipse 3.6 Helios
 * Install Subclipse SVN plugin from Help -> Eclipse Marketplace
 * Update PDT to milestone 2.2, use update site: http://download.eclipse.org/tools/pdt/updates/2.2/milestones/


= Unit Tests =
We use [http://www.phpunit.de PHPUnit framework] for automated unit-testing.

All tests are located inside the *tests/* directory. The directory also contains testing data inside *dummy_twiki_root* subdirectory.


== How to setup PHPUnit ==
On Ubuntu, just install the version from repository using `sudo apt-get install phpuni`.
On other platforms, please refer to the [http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.4/en/installation.html PHPUnit manual]


== How to run tests ==
To run tests agains the source code:
{{{
  #!/bin/sh
  cd path/to/your/twikilib-php
  FULLPATH=`pwd`
  phpunit --include-path "$FULLPATH/src" tests/
}}}

To run tests agains the generated PHAR archive:
{{{
  #!/bin/sh
  cd path/to/your/twikilib-php
  FULLPATH=`pwd`
  phpunit --include-path "phar://$FULLPATH/dist/twikilib-php.phar" tests/
}}}


== How to setup Eclipse for automated unit-testing ==
Install [http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/makegood MakeGood] plugin using `Help->Eclipse Marketplace`.
Make sure you have phpunit in the include_path of twikilib-php project.

`Project->Properties->PHP Include Path->Libraries`. There are more ways how to add phpunit to the include_path. For example, you can add `External Source Folder`, on Ubuntu `/usr/share/php` (PHPUnit is located inside that directory)
