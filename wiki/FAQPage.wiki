= Q: Problem with phpunit =
After checking out the twikilib-php project from SVN, my Eclipse IDE shows an error *"Unbound buildpath container: 'phpunit' in project twikilib-php"* in "Problems" view

 * Make sure that `phpunit` is installed on your system (On Debian-based systems try `sudo apt-get install phpunit`)
   * Navigate into Window->Preferences->PHP->PHP Libraries
   * Add 'phpunit' entry using "New..."
   * Click on the newly added phpunit entry and "Add External folder..." (navigate to the directory where PHPUnit is installed, on Ubuntu it is `/usr/share/php`)

   * Executable Path = /usr/bin/php5
   * PHP ini file (optional) = /etc/php5/conf.d/xdebug.ini
